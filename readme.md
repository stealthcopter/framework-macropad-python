# 


This code is based on the starter code developed here https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/Framework_Inputmodule_CircuitPython.

## Pre Setup

- **Build the firmware** - This requires some modification that isn't documented, see 


## TODO

- **USB Communication**: The serial stuff works fine and REPL (interactive shell) is good but the firmware doesn't allow for use of this connection and a USB data connection at the same time. This feature seems to be something you can enable using some flags, but I've not managed to get it working yet.
